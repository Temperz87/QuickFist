# QuickFist
 
An ULTRAKILL mod that turns the Arm Swap keybind into a Knuckleblaster keybind. This means you only have to press, and/or hold, thee Arm Swap keybind to punch with the Knuckleblaster.

Please note it is currently slightly buggy, so sometimes at the start of a level your arms won't be equipped. To fix this, just go over to the Shop and re-equip your arms.
